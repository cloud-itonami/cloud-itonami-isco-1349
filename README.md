# cloud-itonami-isco-1349

Open Occupation Blueprint for **ISCO-08 1349**: Professional Services Managers Not Elsewhere Classified.

This repository designs a forkable OSS business for an independent professional-services manager serving small clients: a document-handling robot performs record scanning and compliance walkthroughs under a governor-gated actor, so the practice keeps its own engagement and compliance records instead of renting a closed practice-management SaaS.

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot performs
the physical domain work**. Here a document-handling robot performs client-record scanning, filing and compliance-checklist walkthroughs under an actor that proposes
actions and an independent **Professional Services Governor** that gates them. The governor never
dispatches hardware itself; `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions (such as
client fund handling, or regulatory filing submission) require human sign-off.

A live sample of the operator console (robotics safety console, shared template) is rendered in [docs/samples/operator-console.html](docs/samples/operator-console.html) — pure-data HTML output of `kotoba.robotics.ui`.

## Core Contract

```text
engagement scope + compliance checklist + delegation plan
        |
        v
Services Management Advisor -> Professional Services Governor -> coordinate/review, or human sign-off
        |
        v
robot actions (gated) + operating records + audit ledger
```

No automated advice can dispatch a robot action the governor refuses, suppress
an operating record, or disclose sensitive data without governor approval and
audit evidence.
