# cloud-itonami-isco-1349

Open Occupation Blueprint for **ISCO-08 1349**: Professional Services Managers Not Elsewhere Classified.

This repository designs a forkable OSS business for an independent professional-services manager serving small clients: a document-handling robot performs record scanning and compliance walkthroughs under a governor-gated actor, so the practice keeps its own engagement and compliance records instead of renting a closed practice-management SaaS.

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot performs
the physical domain work**. Here a document-handling robot performs client-record scanning, filing and compliance-checklist walkthroughs under an actor that proposes
actions and an independent **Professional Services Governor** that gates them. The governor never
dispatches hardware itself; `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions (such as
client fund handling, or regulatory filing submission) require human sign-off.

A live sample of the operator console (robotics safety console, shared template) is rendered in [docs/samples/operator-console.html](docs/samples/operator-console.html) — pure-data HTML output of `kotoba.robotics.ui`.

## Core Contract

```text
engagement scope + compliance checklist + delegation plan
        |
        v
Services Management Advisor -> Professional Services Governor -> coordinate/review, or human sign-off
        |
        v
robot actions (gated) + operating records + audit ledger
```

No automated advice can dispatch a robot action the governor refuses, suppress
an operating record, or disclose sensitive data without governor approval and
audit evidence.

## Reference implementation (`:maturity :implemented`)

Full itonami Actor pattern (per ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md's Actors
section, alongside `cloud-itonami-isco-6130`, `-8160`, `-2166`, `-2641`,
`-2651`, `-2652`, `-2654`, `-1219`, `-1223`, `-1330` and `-1341`): a real
[`kotoba-lang/langgraph`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/langgraph)
`StateGraph`, with the Advisor and Governor as distinct graph nodes and
human-in-the-loop interrupt/resume via checkpointing.

```text
:intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit            (:ok? true)
                                           +-> :request-approval   (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                           +-> :hold               (:hard? true)
```

- `src/professional_services/store.cljc` — `Store` protocol +
  `MemStore`: registered engagements, committed records, an
  append-only audit ledger.
- `src/professional_services/advisor.cljc` — `Advisor` protocol;
  `mock-advisor` (deterministic, default) proposes a services operation
  from a request; `llm-advisor` wraps a `langchain.model/ChatModel` —
  either way the advisor only ever produces a `:propose`-effect
  proposal, never a committed record, and LLM parse failures always
  yield `confidence 0.0` (forces escalation, never fabricated
  confidence).
- `src/professional_services/governor.cljc` —
  `ProfessionalServicesGovernor/check`: a pure function, wired as its
  own `:govern` node. Hard invariants (unregistered engagement, a
  proposal whose `:effect` isn't `:propose`) always route to `:hold`.
  Escalation invariants (`:handle-client-funds`,
  `:submit-regulatory-filing`, or low advisor confidence) always route
  to `:request-approval` — an `interrupt-before` node that the graph
  checkpoints and only resumes on explicit human approval
  (`actor/approve!`), matching the README's robotics-premise statement
  that client fund handling and regulatory filing submission always
  require human sign-off.
- `src/professional_services/actor.cljc` — `build-graph`,
  `run-request!`, `approve!`: the `langgraph.graph/state-graph` wiring
  itself.

```bash
clojure -M:test
